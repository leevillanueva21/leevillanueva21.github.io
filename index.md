# Mabuhay!
Welcome to my newly-minted portfolio. Pardon the mess as I'm still in the process of learning how to properly code and design for a webpage.

## About Me
I have been in the BPO Industry for 10 years and have been part of Training and Instructional Design for a combined total of 5 years. As a Senior Trainer, one of my core responsibilities was to develop training content to be rolled out to the existing workforce to improve their skills and knowledge. I have since moved to a full-time position as an Instructional Designer specializing in e-learning, microlearning, and experiential/gamified learning.

As a long-time gamer, I have always been interested in how games are designed to hook you in and keep you engaged in the medium. This is why I'm always exploring how effective game design concepts can be applied to improve learning and instructional design. Apart from general game design, I have also recently started dipping my toes in coding (although I am very much new to this, and would not put in anywhere in my resume yet), particularly HTML and Javascript as these are frequently used in e-learning authoring tools.

I hope you like what you see here! Even if you don't though, thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio and I hope to collaborate with you soon. :blush:
